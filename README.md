# W2kPlotter

A python program using Matplotlib to plot bandstructures and density of states from the ouptut files of Wien2k. This is a work in progress...

## Output Files 

### Band structure

For band structure plots you will need to provide:

- case.spaghetti_ene (for x,y coordinates)
- case.agr (for high symmetry point labels and positions)

### Density of States

This part of the program has not been implemented yet, but you will need to provide the various case.dos* files
